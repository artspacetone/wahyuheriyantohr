          <p>
            My career in Human Resources began with a deep fascination for psychologyâ€”understanding what motivates and drives people. For over a decade at TRANS TV, I applied this understanding not just to manage industrial relations, but to truly listen and resolve the issues faced by hundreds of employees.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learned that even the best policies are ineffective without sincere dialogue. I mediated hundreds of disputes, not merely to resolve conflicts, but to build bridges of understanding between employees and management. The result? A reduction in formal grievances by over 15% and a more open work environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, I realized empathy alone isn't enough. In the modern era, HR must be data-driven. This curiosity led me to learn Python, not to become a programmer, but to answer critical questions: 'Why do employees leave?', 'How can we improve efficiency without sacrificing quality?'. By automating reports that once took two days into a three-hour process, I proved that technology can free us from repetitive tasks to focus on what matters most: people.
